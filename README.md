# RS Skills Dashboard

This is a React app written in Typescript, bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It makes use of the
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) framework. It provides people who play an RSPS or OSRS
with an updated design to track their progress towards maxing their accounts in terms of
experience. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
